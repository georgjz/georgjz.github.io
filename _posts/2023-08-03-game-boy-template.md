Has it been a year since I last posted? It seems so. Shame on me. New job, new place, fixing my relationship with someone I dearly love and missed despite me being an irredeemable ingrate - you know, standard stuff.

Anyways, the [Game Boy Competition 2023][gbcompo23] is on! A game jam to create a game for the [Game Boy][gb] within three months. 

I shall venture to participate in said game jam. Why start with only a bit more than a month left? *Because I'm bad with schedules (on this blog), you should know this by now.* (◕‿◕)

But I'm *somewhat* good with [CMake][cmake] and assembly, so I created [this glorious project template for Game Boy games][template]. It's meant to reduce the mental overhead of building a project. This should let you focus more on actual development and coding instead of organizing your files.

Now, is there going to be a dev diary about my Game Boy Color game? Probably!

More on [SNES Assembly Adventure][snesaa01]? Likely!

Sorry again for the long wait, I hope (once again) this blog becomes more active (once again).

See you soon (once again).
