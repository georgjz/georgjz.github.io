# Advent of Code 2019, Day 1

[Advent of Code][aoc] is a fun website where you'll find a daily programming challenge each day. You can solve it in any language of your choice.

I participated last year for the first time. But I got stuck after a few days and gave up. 

So, to force myself to keep going, I'm going to post my solutions here and on GitHub every day. [Haskell][hask] and [Forth][forth] will be my languages of choice. 

Without further ado, here we go.

## Haskell 

All Advent of Code challenges come in two parts.

### Part 1

Here's the problem we need to solve:

> Fuel required to launch a given module is based on its mass. Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.

> For example:
> - For a mass of 12, divide by 3 and round down to get 4, then subtract 2 to get 2.
> - For a mass of 14, dividing by 3 and rounding down still yields 4, so the fuel required is also 2.
> - For a mass of 1969, the fuel required is 654.
> - For a mass of 100756, the fuel required is 33583.

> The Fuel Counter-Upper needs to know the total fuel requirement. To find it, individually calculate the fuel needed for the mass of each module (your puzzle input), then add together all the fuel values.

The [input file][input] is a plain text file with each module's mass on a separate line. This makes it easy to write a parser. I'll use [Megaparsec][megaparsec] for writing a simple parser. 

Here's the parser code: 

```
-- Parser
type Parser = Parsec Void String
        
sc :: Parser ()
sc = L.space space1 empty empty
    
lexeme :: Parser a -> Parser a
lexeme = L.lexeme sc
        
integer :: Parser Integer
integer = lexeme L.decimal
    
masses :: Parser [Integer]
masses = manyTill integer eof
```

If you've never written a parser, check out [this tutorial][parsertutorial]. My parser here is pretty simple: `sc` is the space consumer and will remove all white space from the input (i.e., spaces and new lines). `lexeme` takes a parser, applies it, and then calls the space consumer to remove all white space after the number that has just been parsed.

`integer` and `masses` are pretty self-explanatory: `integer` will parse an integer, `masses` will parse integers until it hits the end of file, or `eof`.

You can test this easily in GHCi:

```
main :: IO () 
main = do 
    input <- readFile "Input.txt"
    let (Right xs) = runParser masses "" input 
    print xs
```

Should output:

```
[50572,126330,143503,136703,56987,96737,140243,94427,84262,149323,87398,132344,72187,90878,72897,101305,129483,101148,66349,76719,86437,84937,73911,141051,61464,85350,81774,129191,130129,118366,125825,61781,98459,69024,75886,119434,108929,117387,149625,79378,102582,102368,117177,132105,137278,149187,136653,70074,115885,73901,81922,133232,112929,80009,116895,61248,140251,98003,109610,132775,55781,110809,109799,125071,71734,104973,75610,148974,144173,89235,89438,64901,142674,105446,55287,64438,82269,99903,97079,72708,108177,130830,50393,141354,123264,116302,51119,127287,137515,109285,110750,93770,54926,57131,136897,97693,135531,122858,112089,98599]
```

Great! Now that we have all the inputs (i.e., module masses) in a list already, it's easy to calculate the needed fuel:

```
fuelPerModule :: Integer -> Integer 
fuelPerModule = subtract 2 . flip div 3
```

Now we only need to map `fuelPerModule` over the input and `sum` it:

```
main :: IO () 
main = do 
    input <- readFile "Input.txt"
    let (Right xs) = runParser masses "" input
        resultP1   = sum . map fuelPerModule $ xs
    putStrLn $ "Result Part 1: " ++ show resultP1
```

Should result in 3412531 if you use my [input file][input].

### Part 2

Here's what to do:

> So, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the total. Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the input mass and repeat the process, continuing until a fuel requirement is zero or negative. 

> For example:
> - A module of mass 14 requires 2 fuel. This fuel requires no further fuel (2 divided by 3 and rounded down is 0, which would call for a negative fuel), so the total fuel required is still just 2.
> - At first, a module of mass 1969 requires 654 fuel. Then, this fuel requires 216 more fuel (654 / 3 - 2). 216 then requires 70 more fuel, which requires 21 fuel, which requires 5 fuel, which requires no further fuel. So, the total fuel required for a module of mass 1969 is 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966.
> - The fuel required by a module of mass 100756 and its fuel is: 33583 + 11192 + 3728 + 1240 + 411 + 135 + 43 + 12 + 2 = 50346.

>What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft when also taking into account the mass of the added fuel? (Calculate the fuel requirements for each module separately, then add them all up at the end.)

One could be tempted to solve this with tail recursion, but I find unfolding more elegant and concise:

```
fuelPerModuleFuel :: Integer -> [Integer]
fuelPerModuleFuel = 
    tail . unfoldr (\a -> if a <= 0 then Nothing else Just (a, next a)) 
  where  
    next = fuelPerModule 
```

Mind the `tail` call. This is to remove the original module mass which would otherwise be part of the list that will be summed up.

Next, we only need to `map`, `concat`, and `sum` this function again over the input list:

```
main :: IO () 
main = do 
    input <- readFile "Input.txt"
    let (Right xs) = runParser masses "" input
        resultP1   = sum . map fuelPerModule $ xs
        resultP2   = sum . concatMap fuelPerModuleFuel $ xs
    putStrLn $ "Result Part 1: " ++ show resultP1
    putStrLn $ "Result Part 2: " ++ show resultP2
```

This results in 5115927. You can check out the complete solution [here][solhask], this file also includes all the imports you'll need. 

Let's move on to Forth.

## Forth 

I'm going to solve both parts in one go here. My basic approach will be the same: Get all the inputs onto the stack, map a function over all inputs to get the correct result.

Here are the functions I'm going to use:

```
: fuelpermodule  ( u -- u )
    3 / 2 - ;

: addtoarray  ( u addr u -- )
    cells + ! ;

: arrayloop  ( addr -- )
    depth 1- 0 do 
        tuck  i addtoarray 
    loop drop ;

: map  ( xt addr len -- )
    0 do  2dup i cells + @ swap execute  -rot  loop 2drop ;

: sum  ( n n -- n )
    depth 1- 0 do + loop ;

: fuelpermodulefuel  ( u -- u )
    dup 0> if 
        dup fuelpermodule
        recurse  +
    else 
        drop 0
    then ;

```

No real surprises here. I'm going to use a variable called `values` to store the input array. Then, I'll use `map` and `sum` to calculate the result:

```
\ Part 1 
s" Input.f" included                    \ get input values to stack
depth constant len                      \ save number of inputs as constant
variable values  depth 1- cells  allot  \ create array for input values
values arrayloop                        \ save input values in array
' fuelpermodule values len map          \ map fuelpermodule function over array
sum                                     \ sum up all fuel
s" Solution to Part 1: " type . cr      \ print result

\ Part 2 -- input still stored in values 
:noname negate ; values len map  sum 
' fuelpermodulefuel values len map  sum 
s" Solution to Part 2: " type . cr      \ print result
bye 
```

Thanks to the input file's format, I don't need to write a parser for this, I can simple "run" the input file to put all values on stack.

This returns: 

```
Solution to Part 1: 3412531 
Solution to Part 2: 5115927 
```

Success! I'll admit it's not the most elegant solution, but it works. There's probably a shorter solution in using `recursve` for part 1 `fuelpermodule`. Then we wouldn't need to store the input in an array first...probably. Find the whole solution [here][solforth].

I'll be adding my solutions to two GitHub repositories:

- [Haskell solutions][ghhask]
- [Forth solutions][ghforth]

See you tomorrow.
