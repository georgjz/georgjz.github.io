# Advent of Code 2019, Day 2

I'll have to admit two things today: I wasn't able to finish part 2 of today's challenge in Forth. And my Haskell solution for part 2 feels pretty hack-y and bruteforce-y.

Without further ado, here we go.

## Haskell 

I'm not super happy with this solution, I feel like revisiting this at a later point. I think the "program" that we need to run could be replace with one function composition.

### Part 1

Find the problem description for part 1 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2).

The [input file][input] is a plain text file with each memory addresses' value on separated by commas. This makes it easy to write a parser. I'll use [Megaparsec][megaparsec] for writing a simple parser. 

Here's the parser code: 

```
-- Parser
type Parser = Parsec Void String
        
sc :: Parser ()
sc = L.space space1 empty empty
    
lexeme :: Parser a -> Parser a
lexeme = L.lexeme sc
        
integer :: Parser Integer
integer = lexeme L.decimal
    
program :: Parser [Integer]
program = integer `sepBy` char ','
```

It's almost the same parser I used for yesterday's challenge.

My idea for the solution is this. First, I "compile" the memory content into a program that I can then fold over the memory content:

```
-- Part 1
execute :: (Int, Int, Int, Int) -> [Int] -> [Int]
execute (opc, a, b, c) mem = m ++ r : mem'
  where 
    r = case opc of 1 -> mem !! a + mem !! b 
                    2 -> mem !! a * mem !! b 
    (m,_:mem') = splitAt c mem

compile :: [Int] -> [(Int, Int, Int, Int)]
compile (99:_) = [] 
compile (a:b:c:d:r) = (a,b,c,d) : compile r

executePrg:: [(Int, Int, Int, Int)] -> [Int] -> [Int]
executePrg prg mem = foldl (flip execute) mem prg
```

I think this could be further simplified with something along the lines of `compose = foldr (.) id` and thus composing the list of program commands to run into a single function to apply to memory. But I couldn't get it to work in reasonable time. 

```
main :: IO () 
main = do 
    input <- readFile "Input.txt"
    let (Right xs) = runParser program "" input
        prg        = compile xs
        resultP1   = head $ executePrg prg xs
    putStrLn $ "Result part 1: " ++ show resultP1
```

Should result in 3306701 if you use my [input file][input].

### Part 2

Part 2 asks use to replace the second and third element of the input file such that when running about program, the result returns as 19690720 (the date of the moon landing).

This is a pretty ugly brute force solution:

```
-- Part 2 
tests :: [(Int, Int)]
tests = [(x,y) | x <- [1..99], y <- [1..99]]

testMem :: [Int] -> Int -> (Int, Int) -> Bool
testMem mem tv (x, y) = result == tv 
  where 
    result = head $ executePrg prg mem' 
    prg = compile mem'
    mem' = 1 : x : y : drop 3 mem

testMem' :: [Int] -> Int -> [(Int, Int)] -> (Int, Int)
testMem' mem tv (t:ts) =
    if testMem mem tv t then t 
                        else testMem' mem tv ts
```

I simple create a tuple with all noun-verb combinations, and run all possible combinations until I find one that returns 19690720. Ugly but workable.

This results in 7621. You can check out the complete solution [here][solhask], this file also includes all the imports you'll need. 

Let's move on to Forth.

## Forth 

As I said, I didn't make it past part 1 here. I'm really unhappy with my array words here. I think I'll need to rework them tomorrow before moving forward.

That being said, here's the solution to part 1:

```
\ Solution for Advent of Code 2019 Day 2 in Forth

: addtoarray  ( u addr u -- )
    cells + ! ;

: arrayloop  ( addr -- )
    depth 1- 0 do 
        tuck  i addtoarray 
    loop drop ;

: readarray  ( addr u -- u )
     cells +  @ ;
    
: readarrayindirect  ( addr u -- u )
    readarray over swap readarray ;

: map  ( xt addr len -- )
    0 do  2dup i cells + @ swap execute  -rot  loop 2drop ;

: sum  ( n n -- n )
    depth 1- 0 do + loop ;

: flip  ( a b c -- c b a )
    swap rot ;

: 4reverse  ( a b c d -- d c b a )
    swap 2swap swap ;

: getprg  ( addr u -- u u u u )
    4 0 do
        2dup I + readarray -rot
    loop  
    2drop 4reverse ;

: MainLoop  ( addr len -- )
    0 do
        dup dup I  ( -- addr addr u )   
        \ put four elements on stack 
        over >r
        getprg  
        r>       ( -- addr u u u u addr )
        swap dup 1 = if 
            drop 
            tuck swap readarray 
            -rot swap readarray 
            +
        else 2 = if 
            tuck swap readarray 
            -rot swap readarray 
            *
            else
                \ drop drop drop drop drop 
                leave
            then
        then
        -rot addtoarray
    4 +loop
    drop 
;

." Solution to part 1: " . cr 
bye
```

I used a bit of a cheat here by first writing a small Haskell program to refactor the input file such that Gforth can "run" to put all values on stack. See `Cheat.hs` in the [Forth solution repository][ghforth] for day 2. 

I find the `MainLoop` word really ugly, this should definitely be split up into more words. There are even some left over words from another solution strategy I attempted. 

Again, not a good solution. Hope tomorrow goes better.

This returns: 

```
Solution to Part 1: 3306701
```

I'll be adding my solutions to two GitHub repositories:

- [Haskell solutions][ghhask]
- [Forth solutions][ghforth]

See you tomorrow.
