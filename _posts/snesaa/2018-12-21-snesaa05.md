*Update February 2022*: All code examples from all articles in this series can now be found on [Github in one repository](https://github.com/georgjz/snes-assembly-adventure-code.git)

Welcome back, Adventurer. In this article, I'll introduce you to subroutines. You will learn

* What the stack is and how it works
* What subroutines are and how they work

We'll write a simple subroutine that adds the value in register X to the value in register Y.

But before we dive deeper into subroutines, we first need to introduce the *stack*. I'll probably come back to the stack several times in future articles since it's such a great and important concept to understand. So this is by no way a complete description of the stack and all its functionality.

## The Stack

The stack formally called a LIFO (last-in, first-out) structure, is a certain range of memory locations where we can store data. The most important characteristic of a stack is that it is a *chronological* structure. So whatever data we *pushed* last onto the stack, is the first data that gets *pulled* from the stack.

When we want to place data on the stack, we say we're **pushing** onto (the top) of the stack; when we want to retrieve that data again from the stack, we say we're **pulling** data from (the top of) the stack (*Note*: Some processor architectures use *pop* instead of *pull*; popping and pulling from stack are the same thing, just different words).

Imagine a stack of plates: Whenever we *push* a plate on top of the stack, we first need to *pull* the last plate we put on top of the stack before we can *pull* any of the plates beneath it.

Here is how the stack on the 65816 works. I'll first describe the operations in general, then I'll show you some code examples.

Whenever **we push data onto the stack**, the 65816 takes the value inside the internal *stack pointer* or SP and decrements it by either one, two, or three (we will see shortly why). Then it uses the new stack pointer (+1) as the address to store the data in memory. I'll explain the '(+1)' in a moment.

Whenever **we pull data from the stack**, the 65816 loads the data from the address stored in the stack pointer (+1), then increments the stack pointer by either one, two, or three.

Here is what the '(+1)' part in the paragraphs above means: The stack pointer on a 65816 always points *one byte beyond* the data we last pushed onto the stack. For example, if the stack pointer currently holds the value `$1ffa` and we pull one byte from the stack, the data stored at address `$1ffb` (stack pointer + 1) will be pulled, and the stack pointer set to `$1ffb`.

Likewise, if we push two bytes onto the stack, the stack pointer will decrement by two from `$1ffa` to `$1ff8`, the two bytes we push onto the stack are then stored at the addresses `$1ff9` and `$1ffa` respectively.

Let's make this a bit clearer with a simple code example. This code will also include code to switch the 65816 from emulation to native mode and set the index registers X and Y to 16-bit, while the accumulator will operate in 8-bit mode.

{% gist fd7641e08645ddeaf7d7c830a5c35e1c %}

**Lines 4 through 10**: This shouldn't be a surprise for you. We switch the 65816 to native mode, set the index registers to 16-bit, the accumulator to 8-bit, and set up the stack pointer to start at $1fff.

**Lines 13 through 15**: We load A, X, and Y with different values.

**Lines 17 through 19**: We push all three working registers to the stack.

**Lines 21 through 23**: Now we pull all three values back into the registers. Observe how we switched the order in which registers values are pulled from the stack. The last value we pushed onto the stack was from Y. After that, we pull that value back into X, and then we pull the next value from the stack into Y. So X and Y have switched values.

This is a very simple example. In the next section, we'll see how the stack can help us write modular code. If you struggle to understand this code, try tracing the values of all registers after each opcode is executed.

Here are the new opcodes you just learned:

{% highlight shell %}
pha : PusH Accumulator
phx : PusH X register
phy : PusH Y register
pla : PulL Accumulator
plx : PulL X register
ply : PulL Y register
{% endhighlight %}

## Subroutines

If you're familiar with any programming language, you have most probably heard of *functions* (sometimes also called *procedures*). Functions are one of the most fundamental units of any programming language. It helps us to abstract our program and reuse code.

When programming in 65816 machine language, we call these programming units *subroutines* instead of functions. But they are (more or less) the same thing.

When we call a subroutine in our code the following will happen: The 65816 will push the *program counter* or PC onto the stack (this is the *return address* where execution will resume after the subroutine is done). Then it will jump to the subroutine and continue execution from there. Once the subroutine is done, we tell the CPU to return to where it left off before by pulling the return address we pushed onto the stack earlier back into the PC.

Let's write a simple example. We want to write a subroutine called `AddXtoY`. This subroutine will execute a 16-bit addition: It will add the value in the register X to the value in register Y (and store it in Y).

As always, I'll first show you the code, then discuss it in detail.

{% gist 4d1d56f2743b33643b0d8c18cd49dc2e %}

Let's go through this line by line.

**Lines 4 through 10**: You know the drill. We switch the 65816 to emulation mode, set the index registers to 16-bit, the accumulator to 8-bit, and set up the stack pointer to start at $1fff.

**Lines 13 and 14**: Here we store the values we want to add. No surprises here either.

**Line 15**: Now, this is where the interesting stuff happens. First, here's a new opcode:

{% highlight shell %}
jsr : Jump to SubRoutine
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, we use *absolute addressing* to call the subroutine. Here is how it works: First, the CPU pushed the current program counter + 2 onto the stack (so when we return from the subroutine, execution will resume at the instruction *after* `jsr`). Then, the operand is loaded into the program counter. In our example, the address of `AddXtoY` is loaded into the program counter and execution will, therefore, resume from there. If you find this confusing, check the *Links and References* section at the end of this article. There you'll find some helpful resources.

**Lines 21 through 25**: Now we're inside the subroutine. First, we set the accumulator to 16-bit, since we want to execute a 16-bit addition. We use `phx` to save the content of X on the stack. Next, we use `tya` to transfer Y into A. Then we clear the carry flag in preparation for an addition. Here's a list of all transfer opcodes:

{% highlight shell %}
tax : Transfer Accumulator to X register
tay : Transfer Accumulator to Y register
tsx : Transfer Stack pointer to X register
txa : Transfer X register to Accumulator
txs : Transfer X register to Stack pointer
txy : Transfer X register to Y register
tya : Transfer Y register to Accumulator
tyx : Transfer Y register to X register
{% endhighlight %}

When using the transfer opcodes there are two important things to remember: First, observe from the list above that you transfer data between the index registers, or between the index registers and the accumulator. But the stack pointer can *only be transferred from or to the X register*.

Second, when transferring data between registers, the *size of the data transferred is the size of the destination register*. What does that mean? Remember that we can set the size of the accumulator and index registers independently. What happens if the index registers are set to 16-bit and the accumulator to 8-bit? If `Y = $aaaa` and `A = $1111`, then after a `tya` instruction, A will be `A = $11aa`. Since the accumulator was set to 8-bit, only one byte is transferred, even though both registers can hold 16-bit. This is an important thing to remember since: Transferring into a register set to 8-bit will leave the high byte of that register untouched.

In our example, we set the accumulator to 16-bit in line 21, so we don't have to worry about that. Y is in A and X on the stack. So in line 25, we add X saved on the stack to A. This demonstrates a new addressing mode: *stack relative addressing*.

This is an extremely powerful addressing mode. In a later article, I will show you how to pass arguments to your subroutine by stack, rather than by register like we did here. This offers way more flexibility. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

*Stack relative addressing* works like this: The effective address is calculated by adding the *offset* (the first operand of the opcode) to the current value of the stack pointer. The data at the effective address is then used for the operation. Earlier I told you that the stack pointer will always point to the last data pushed onto the stack plus one (another way to look at it is that the stack pointer is set to the first free address on the stack). In our case, we know that we pushed X onto the stack last, so we only have to add one to the stack pointer to obtain the address to the value from X we stored there.

**Lines 26 through 28**: Now we have the sum of X and Y stored in the accumulator. But we want it to be in Y, so we transfer the accumulator to Y. Since the index registers are set to 16-bit, both high and low byte are transferred to Y. Next, we pull X back into X from the stack. Why do we need to do this? We don't need X anymore.

{% highlight shell %}
rts : ReTurn from Subroutine
{% endhighlight %}

Remember that when we jumped to the subroutine, `jsr` stored the *return address for the subroutine* on the stack. The last instruction in the subroutine, `rts`, expects that the correct return address is on the stack. `rts` will simply pull whatever return address the stack pointer is pointing to and continue execution there. If we hadn't first pulled X from the stack, then `rts` would jump to $1212 (the value from X we pushed onto the stack earlier); this would be an error, we don't know what is at the address $1212. So executing any code from there would lead to chaos.

**Line 17**: After `rts`, we continue execution here and immediately tell the CPU to stop. That's it. You wrote your first subroutine!

## Conclusion

You learned a new important tool, the subroutine. Utilizing subroutines will make our code more modular and reusable. [Next time][4], we will use subroutines to improve the sprite example from part four of this series. We will learn about *Direct Memory Access* and let the sprites bounce off the screen boundaries. Almost like a real game! As always, if you have any questions, please use the comment function below and I'll try my best to help.
