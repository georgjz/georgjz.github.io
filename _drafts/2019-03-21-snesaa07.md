### Conclusion

Wow, that was a lot of text! This was a bit heavy on the theory side of things. But I think it will help you a lot down the line to write working code and keep things manageable. Next time, we'll use subroutines to improve the sprite demo from [part 4][2] and make the sprites bounce off the screen boundaries.
