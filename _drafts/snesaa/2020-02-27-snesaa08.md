Welcome back, Adventurer! [Last time][1], we learned a bit more about direct memory access and moving sprites.

This time, we'll read the joypad and move the sprite accordingly. So this time we will

* read and process input from the joypad
* make the sprite move according to input
* implement some simple collision detection to make the sprite stay on screen

## Reading The Joypad

Let's look at the sprite demo code again:

{% gist 0f7404f3d591d426d0e767db18716c75 %}

If we scan the code closely, we see that there is a lot of code repetition. For example, the two loops `VRAMLoop` and `CGRAMLoop` starting at line 42 and 58 respectively are almost identical. Same goes for the code between lines 74 and 112 that set up the OAMRAM data for all four sprites. If you have programmed in any other language before, you'd probably immediately go for a function to keep your code shorter, more readable, and concise.

We will replace those two sections mentioned above with subroutines. These subroutines will be very useful later on when we write more complicated demos and games. Moving data to VRAM, CGRAM, and OAMRAM is something we do pretty much *every* frame.

So let's start by moving some of the repetitive code into subroutines:

{% gist 6a7838f6dbdcce750c11a98228e3d990 %}

This code shouldn't hold any surprises to you by now. We simply moved the code for loading VRAM, CGRAM, and OAMRAM into subroutines and replaced the moved code sections with subroutine calls. Easy.

But there's still room for improvement. In `LoadVRAM`, we use the label `SpriteData` to access the sprites raw data in memory. While this works, what if you want to load memory from another memory location than `SpriteData`? You'd need to rewrite the whole subroutine. Not very convenient.

But thankfully, there's a solution.

## Passing Addresses as Arguments

Congratulations! Your first moving sprites!

## Conclusion

There was a lot of new stuff here, so make sure to study the code examples closely. I'd also encourage you to experiment a bit. Can you make the sprites bounce only on the right half of the screen? Can you modulize the game logic code with subroutines? Make each sprite move and bounce individually? Bounce off each other? Challenge yourself!

[Next time][2], we'll learn how to read the joypad and make the sprites react to your input.
