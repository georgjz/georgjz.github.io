Welcome back, Adventurer! [Last time][last], we learned how to build our code with CMake.

This time, we'll refactor our sprite demo to

* make code/subroutines easier to reuse
* autogenerate assets and headers with CMake

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a nice project template you can reuse in the future.

<figure>
    <a href="{{ "/assets/snesaa/10snesaa10_titlecard.gif" | uri_escape | absolute_url }}">
        <img src="{{ "/assets/snesaa/10snesaa10_titlecard.gif" | uri_escape | absolute_url }}">
    </a>
</figure>

Without further ado, let's get started!

## Asset


## Conclusion

There was a lot of new stuff here, so make sure to study the code examples closely. I'd also encourage you to experiment a bit. Can you make the sprites bounce only on the right half of the screen? Can you modulize the game logic code with subroutines? Make each sprite move and bounce individually? Bounce off each other? Challenge yourself!

[Next time][2], we'll learn how to read the joypad and make the sprites react to your input.

Lastly, I'm very sorry this update took so long; I've been working on a few other things but I'm determined to return to a weekly Thursday schedule as promised. Your feedback is much appreciated and a huge motivation! Stay tuned!
