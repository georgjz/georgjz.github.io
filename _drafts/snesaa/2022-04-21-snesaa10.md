Welcome back, Adventurer! [Last time][last], we learned how to build our code with CMake.

This time, we'll restructure our sprite demo to

* separate assets into their own subdirectory
* autogenerate assets and headers with CMake

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have a nice project template you can reuse in the future. As always, the code

<figure>
    <a href="{{ "/assets/snesaa/10/snesaa10_titlecard.gif" | uri_escape | absolute_url }}">
        <img src="{{ "/assets/snesaa/10/snesaa10_titlecard.gif" | uri_escape | absolute_url }}">
    </a>
</figure>

Without further ado, let's get started!

## Keep Assets Separate From Code

We already saw a bit of code generation with CMake [in the last tutorial][last]. At the moment, our source and asset files live in the same directory. As your project grows, this can become unwieldy. So the first thing we'll do is move the assets into their own subdirectory. Create a new subdirectory `assets` and move both `SpriteColors.pal` and `Sprites.vra` into it. Create a new file called `CMakeLists.txt` in the new subdirectory `assets`:

```cmake
# snes_cradle/assets/CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.21 FATAL_ERROR )
```

We'll add commands to it in a moment. Your directory structure should look like this now:

```
snes_cradle/
    assets/
        CMakeLists.txt
        SpriteColors.pal
        Sprites.vra
    cmake/
        CMakeCA65816Compiler.cmake.in
        CMakeCA65816Information.cmake
        CMakeDetermineCA65816Compiler.cmake
        CMakeTestCA65816Compiler.cmake
    src/
        CMakeLists.txt
        JoypadSprite.s
    CMakeLists.txt
    MemoryMap.cfg
```

If we try to build this, it will fail with the following error messages:

```
$ cmake --build build
[1/2] Building CA65816 object CMakeFiles\JoypadSpriteDemo.dir\src\JoypadSprite.s.o
FAILED: CMakeFiles/JoypadSpriteDemo.dir/src/JoypadSprite.s.o
ca65.exe --cpu 65816
         -s
         -o CMakeFiles\JoypadSpriteDemo.dir\src\JoypadSprite.s.o
         ~\snes_cradle\src\JoypadSprite.s
~\snes_cradle\src\JoypadSprite.s:69: Error: Cannot open include file 'Sprites.vra': No such file or directory
~\snes_cradle\src\JoypadSprite.s:70: Error: Cannot open include file 'SpriteColors.pal': No such file or directory
ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.
```

As you can see, ca65 can no longer find `Sprites.vra` and `SpriteColors.pal` after we moved them into `assets` (The output has been edited for clarity, so your output may differ a bit). This problem can be resolved in two ways. We could change the commands in `JoypadSprite.s` to include relative paths, namely, `.incbin "../assets/Sprites.vra"` and `.incbin "../assets/SpriteColors.pal"`, respectively. The assembler will then find the asset files no problem. But this isn't ideal. As the number of source and asset files grows, we'll probably want to move them into a more granular directory structure. So each time we move a file, we would have to change each single file that references it. That's how bugs and build errors are born.

The second option is to tell the [ca65 assembler where to find include files](https://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html#ss2.1). The documentation tells us that the `--bin-include-dir` command line argument is used for that. So we need to execute

```
$ ca65 --cpu 65816 --bin-include-dir ../assets -s -o JoypadSprite.o JoypadSprite.s
```

For the source code to assemble correctly. This puts us a bit in a pickle. The ca65 assembler uses two different command line arguments for file inclusion: one for (binary) files included with `.incbin` (`--bin-include-dir`), and another for `.include` (`--include-dir` or shorter `-I`).

The question we have to answer here, is whether we want to use the CMake command [`target_include_directories`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html) for binary (`.incbin`) or source files (`.include`). I've decided to opt for the latter, as a SNES game project will probably include a bit more source files than binary/asset files.

For binary files, we'll instead use the CMake command [`target_compile_options`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_options.html) to add `--bin-include-dir` to our build command. Let's edit `assets/CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# snes_cradle/assets/CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.21 FATAL_ERROR )

target_compile_options( ${PROJECT_NAME}
    PRIVATE "SHELL:--bin-include-dir ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}" )
```

Here we tell CMake to add `--bin-include-dir` followed by the directory the `CMakeLists.txt` file is located in (here, `assets`) to the compiler flags for the target. Next, we need to tell CMake what to do with those flags. The `SHELL` part is necessary to [avoid option de-duplication](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_options.html#option-de-duplication). See [ca65 search paths](https://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html#search-paths) for details.

Next, we need to add our new `assets` subdirectory to the main `CMakeLists.txt` in the project's root directory file:

```cmake
# snes_cradle/CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.21 FATAL_ERROR )

set( MEMORY_MAP_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/MemoryMap.cfg )
list( APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake" )

project( JoypadSpriteDemo
         LANGUAGES CA65816 )

add_executable( ${PROJECT_NAME} "" )
add_subdirectory( assets )
add_subdirectory( src )
set_target_properties( ${PROJECT_NAME}
    PROPERTIES SUFFIX ".smc" )

# Check if the path to the memory map file is set
if( NOT DEFINED MEMORY_MAP_FILE )
  message( FATAL_ERROR "Path to memory map file not set!" )
endif( NOT DEFINED MEMORY_MAP_FILE )
```

All we did here was add `add_subdirectory( assets )`. Finally, we need to update the build command itself in `cmake/CMakeCA65816Information.cmake`:

```cmake
# snes_cradle/cmake/CMakeCA65816Information.cmake

# How to build objects
set( CMAKE_CA65816_COMPILE_OBJECT
    "<CMAKE_CA65816_COMPILER> --cpu 65816 \
                              <FLAGS> \
                              -s \
                              -o <OBJECT> \
                              <SOURCE>"
)

# How to build executables
set( CMAKE_CA65816_LINK_EXECUTABLE
    "ld65 -C ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/MemoryMap.cfg \
          <OBJECTS> \
          -o <TARGET>"
)

set( CMAKE_CA65816_INFORMATION_LOADED 1 )
```

We only need to add a single line again, namely, the `<FLAGS>` argument. Now rerun CMake and the error message from earlier should no longer show. As always, test the ROM you just built in your emulator verify everything still works.

## Creating a Header and Source File For Assets

We'll need to generate a header so that different source files can access the addresses where the assets are stored. We want to be able to access assets/addresses with the `.include` directive. In constrast, if we included the assets with `.incbin` in each source file (that accesses the assets) it could copy the whole asset data several times into the ROM! That'd be a waste of precious ROM memory. Instead, we're going to create a header and a source file for the assets. Thankfully, [cc65][cc65] makes it easy for use to create something akin to [header guards][guards].

First, we're going to create a new source file called `assets/Assets.s`:

{% gist 0038a118b8ff581470ce14c6f1060256 %}

This file essentially moves the `SPRITEDATA` segment from lines 68 through 70 of `src/JoypadSprite.s` into its own file. It also adds a couple of [`.export`](https://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html#ss11.37) directives to make the symbols available to other parts of the code (i.e., modules). In general, all symbols are local to the files/modules they're in. If you want to make them available to other sources/modules, you need to export them.

Next, we create the `assets/Assets.inc` header file:

{% gist 8f20d0c9e872297678a76e4ce180c762 %}

This file simply imports the symbols we just exported from `assets/Assets.s` into each file that includes `assets/Asset.inc`. We add a header guard to protect the file from multiple inclusions (and therefore causing symbol redefined errors).

Since there's a new file that needs assembling, we also update `assets/CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# snes_cradle/assets/CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.21 FATAL_ERROR )

target_compile_options( ${PROJECT_NAME}
    PRIVATE "SHELL:-I ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}" )

target_sources( ${PROJECT_NAME}
    PRIVATE Assets.s )
```

Note that we replaced some options in `target_compile_options`. This is about `--bin-include-dir` VS `--include-dir` we talked about above. So now we only need to tell the build system where to find include files included with `target_include_directories`.

Finally, we update `src/JoypadSprite.s`. Just replace lines 68 through 70 with `.include "Assets.inc". Don't forget to rerun CMake and test your ROM in an emulator.

Your directory structure should now look like this:

```
snes_cradle/
    assets/
        Assets.inc
        Assets.s
        CMakeLists.txt
        SpriteColors.pal
        Sprites.vra
    cmake/
        CMakeCA65816Compiler.cmake.in
        CMakeCA65816Information.cmake
        CMakeDetermineCA65816Compiler.cmake
        CMakeTestCA65816Compiler.cmake
    src/
        CMakeLists.txt
        JoypadSprite.s
    CMakeLists.txt
    MemoryMap.cfg
```
