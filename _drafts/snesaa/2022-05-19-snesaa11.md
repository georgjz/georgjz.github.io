# DRAFT

Welcome back, Adventurer! [Last time][1], we learned how to use CMake and cc65 to automate the build process.

This time we'll look at the background modes the SNES supports. There will be little code here. It is more about understanding how backgrounds on the SNES work in general. The SNES offers different functionality like window masking, screen addition/subtraction, mosaic effects, etc. that are easier to follow once basic background construction is understood.

We will look at

* how the eight background modes work,
* what the twelve background main functions do,
* and how background priority works.

## Reading The Joypad


## Conclusion

There was a lot of new stuff here, so make sure to study the code examples closely. I'd also encourage you to experiment a bit. Can you make the sprites bounce only on the right half of the screen? Can you modulize the game logic code with subroutines? Make each sprite move and bounce individually? Bounce off each other? Challenge yourself!

Next time, we'll learn how to read the joypad and make the sprites react to your input.

Lastly, I'm very sorry this update took so long; I've been working on a few other things but I'm determined to return to a weekly Thursday schedule as promised. Your feedback is much appreciated and a huge motivation! Stay tuned!
