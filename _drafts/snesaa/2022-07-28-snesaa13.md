Welcome back, Adventurer! [Last time][1], we learned a bit more about direct memory access and moving sprites.

This time, we'll read the joypad and move the sprite accordingly. So this time we will

* read and process input from the joypad
* make the sprite move according to input
* implement some simple collision detection to make the sprite stay on screen

## Reading The Joypad


## Conclusion

There was a lot of new stuff here, so make sure to study the code examples closely. I'd also encourage you to experiment a bit. Can you make the sprites bounce only on the right half of the screen? Can you modulize the game logic code with subroutines? Make each sprite move and bounce individually? Bounce off each other? Challenge yourself!

Next time, we'll learn how to read the joypad and make the sprites react to your input.

Lastly, I'm very sorry this update took so long; I've been working on a few other things but I'm determined to return to a weekly Thursday schedule as promised. Your feedback is much appreciated and a huge motivation! Stay tuned!
