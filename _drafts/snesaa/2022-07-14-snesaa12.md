# DRAFT

Welcome back, Adventurer! [Last time][last], we learned how to use CMake and cc65 to automate the build process.

This time we'll refactor the modular example from the previous article to become a more general project template we can use in the future. This project template will

* have a handful of helper subroutines for loading and clearing VRAM, CGRAM and OAM, handling the joypad;
* initialize the SNES to be in a defined state; i.e., clear all memory and set registers to predefined values;
* have a simple main game loop and v-blank loop that do nothing.

The final project template can be found [on GitHub][snesaagithub].

We'll only make small changes to the overall structure. Let's go.

## What We Got So Far



## Conclusion

We did a lot of housekeeping and refactoring. Nothing really new happened here, but this little template should allow us to skip the initial setup each new project needs. So we can focus on writing our next demo or game. Which is what we will do next.

Next time, we'll be learning a bit more about sprites, sprite ordering/priority and how to generate color palettes on the fly.
