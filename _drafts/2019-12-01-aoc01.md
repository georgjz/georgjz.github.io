# Advent of Code 2019 Day 1

[Advent of Code][aoc] is a fun website where you'll find a daily programming challenge each day. You can solve it in any language of your choice.

I participated last year for the first time. But I got stuck after a few days and gave up. 

So, to force myself to keep going, I'm going to post my solutions here and on GitHub every day. [Haskell][hask] and [Forth][forth] will be my languages of choice. 

Without further ado, here we go.

## Haskell 

Here's the problem we need to solve:

> Fuel required to launch a given module is based on its mass. Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.

> For example:
> - For a mass of 12, divide by 3 and round down to get 4, then subtract 2 to get 2.
> - For a mass of 14, dividing by 3 and rounding down still yields 4, so the fuel required is also 2.
> - For a mass of 1969, the fuel required is 654.
> - For a mass of 100756, the fuel required is 33583.

> The Fuel Counter-Upper needs to know the total fuel requirement. To find it, individually calculate the fuel needed for the mass of each module (your puzzle input), then add together all the fuel values.
