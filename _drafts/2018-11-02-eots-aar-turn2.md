# DRAFT

### Introduction
Besides machine language programming, I enjoy strategy games, especially hex and counter wargames. One of my favorites is [Empire of The Sun][1] by Mark Herman. This game simulates the Pacific Theater of World War II on an operational level. The Japanese must force the US into negotiating a peace treaty by lowering US political will, while the Allies must push back the Japanese and prevent them from taking precious resources that will fuel the Japanese war machine.

I will assume you, the reader, are somewhat familiar with the [rules][2]. *Empire of The Sun* is a CDG or *Card Driven Game*. If you're interested in details, here is a [good video][3] by the designer himself explaining the basics. There is another good [series of videos][4] by John Steidl that explain the basic rules and concepts in great detail.

That being said, let's get into it!

### Setup
I found my opponent on [Board Game Geek][5]. We agreed to use [Vassal][6] to start a PBEM (play by e-mail) game. Empire of The Sun plays very well as PBEM game, since planing a turn's strategy can be time-consuming. It also eliminates the need to somehow store the game between sessions (a problem every wargamer faces). We will play the 1942 Campaign scenario:

[1942 start up]

As per scenario rules, the Allies get free Naval Emergency Movements to open the game. My opponent moves the US Asia Fleet (one CA, one DD unit) into Tjilatjap (2019), where the Dutch light cruiser is already waiting. A bit of an unorthodox move. But one that will force me to improvise a bit. A lucky card draw helps me greatly to reduce the threat this fleet poses, as we will see shortly.

After the NEM, we draw our opening hands. I opt not to take the historical variant (which would give me three fixed cards and four random), so I draw seven random cards. The Allies opt to take the *Arcadia Conference* card (\#4) since there really isn't a reason not to. He draws four additional cards to complete his hand.

Here's the Japanese opening hand:

[cards gallery]

I get four offensive cards, two political cards, and one reaction card. Not a bad hand at all. The smaller movement allowance of *Naval Battle of Guadalcanal* (\#20) is something to look for since naval units will only be able to move up to 10 hexes. Drawing both *Tokyo Express* cards (\#28 and \#44) in the same turn might be a bit of a bummer since it will waste the Tokyo Express markers. This might hurt me later in the game. But the two additional ASP will come in very handy. *Operation RE* (\#23) is not a super strong card, but might be useful for a small offensive and/or moving around units for a later offensive phase. The *War In Europe* cards (\#57) are most effective early in the game for the Japanese. Might be a candidate for event play if all of my offensives go smoothly. Now, *Mahatma Gandhi* (\#15) is an interesting card. Some players absolutely loathe this card when played as an event, since it will cost them a ground replacement step and move India closer to surrender. On the other hand, playing the event as Japan pretty much means that they are willing to commit resources to the conquest of the Burma-India area; else it's a wasted 3 OC card in my opinion (although this game is a lot about simply *threatening* your opponent's positions). Lastly, *JN25 Code Change* (\#69) might not be really useful this early, since the Allies don't really have the units to run a proper offensive yet. But I have an idea for utilizing this 1 OC card this turn.

So, I believe this to be quite a decent opening hand that will let me wreak some serious havoc on my opponent in this turn.
