### The Blog
This is my primary blogging platform. I mainly write about assembly and machine code programming on old video game consoles like the Atari 2600, SNES, or even Playstation. You will find some demos and homebrews I wrote for various machines.

You can [stalk me on tumblr](https://georgsyard.tumblr.com) too, where I share book covers of old programming books. You will also find my sorry attempts at pixel art and drawings there.

I still refuse to go on twitter. I just loath that platform. That might change in the future.

### Me
Besides assembly programming, I play games about assembly programming like [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/) or [SHENZEN I/O](http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/).

When I'm *not* assembling machine code by hand, I like to go out and enjoy `(beer)\1{1,}`. I hope to build me a nice sailing boat next summer.
